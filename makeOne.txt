I try recursion. It seems to be work, but always repeat same way.
How can I make it goes to every each path?
That would be key of this.
---------------10.28.------------------
The minimum common multiple of 5, 3, and 2 is 30.
Therefore, if the number is calculated as the rest, it is repeated by 30 cycles.
The corresponding table is this
Value is 0 when the rest is zero, others are 1.
The multiplication of number and table value can be used as a condition.
But I need to look up some exception.
